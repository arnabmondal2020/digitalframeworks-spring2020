Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak, nursing homes all throughout the country have become hotspots for the virus. I wonder if there is any co-relation between the number of cases in each nursing home and their previous lack of proper infection prevention protocols.

I will collect data by going through Medicareâ€™s nursing home inspection reports. I will keep an updated list of nursing homes with outbreaks and the number of outbreaks in each facility with either the help of press releases of the state health departments or by contacting the health departments directly.

I could visualize the health inspection ratings, quality measure ratings, total health and infection deficiencies of the nursing homes, and compare them with the number of coronavirus incidents at the facilities.

It is timely because the COVID-19 outbreak is a worldwide pandemic and more people are being infected by it and dying every day.

For sources, I could talk to ombudsmen and nursing home reform advocates from different states, as well as the family of the residents of nursing homes with coronavirus outbreak.
