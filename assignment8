I found that among the Senate Candidates, the Democrats had consistently raised more money as a whole than Republicans since 2005 while the Republican candidates were always left with a more cumulative debt than the Democrats, except for in 2015 when the Republicans raised more money and had the lower debt.

To follow this story, I would compare the total amount of money raised for every senate election since 2005 by Democrats and the debt accrued to that of the Republicans. I would also interview a few political analysts for their opinion. This would likely take five days to report.

In order to find my story, I did the following:
 1.	I searched the FEC website for 2019-2020 election data summaries. 
 2.	I compared the Democrat data for Receipts and Debt to the Republican ones.
 3.	Then I created two bar charts to compare the two separate categories.

Hed: Democrats have consistently raised more election funds than Republicans
