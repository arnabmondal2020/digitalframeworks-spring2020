Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak, nursing homes all throughout the country have become hotspots for the virus. I wonder if there is any co-relation between the number of cases in each nursing home and their previous lack of proper infection prevention protocols.

Here are the features I'll be collecting, and an explanation of why:
* Nursing home name	
* Location	
* Unique ID	
* Federal Provider Number	
* Provider Name	
* Provider Address	
* Provider City	
* Provider State	
* Provider Zip Code	
* Provider County Name	
* Ownership Type	
* Legal Business Name	
* Number of Certified Beds	
* Average Number of Residents Per Day	
* Overall Rating	
* Health Inspection Rating	
* Quality Measure Rating	
* Staffing Rating	
* Number incidents reported in the facility	
* Number of Substantiated Complaints (NATIONAL AVERAGE: 4.25)	
* Number of Fines (NATIONAL AVERAGE: 0.46)	
* Total Amount of Fines in Dollars	
* Number of Payment Denials	
* Total Number of Penalties	
* Special Focus Status	
* Abuse Icon	
* Cycles with Infection deficiencies (NATIONAL AVERAGE: 1.25)	
* Cycles with severe deficiencies (all types)	
* Cycles with immediate jeopardy (all types)	
* Total health deficiencies (NATIONAL AVERAGE: 23.76)	
* Total infection deficiencies (NATIONAL AVERAGE: 1.34)	
* Total severe deficiencies (all types) (NATIONAL AVERAGE: 1.13)	
* Total immediate jeopardy deficiencies (all types)	
* Total severe infection deficiencies (NATIONAL AVERAGE: 0.01)

I will collect data by going through Medicareâ€™s nursing home inspection reports. I will keep an updated list of nursing homes with outbreaks and the number of outbreaks in each facility with either the help of press releases of the state health departments or by contacting the health departments directly.
